# 🎭 3D Models for MIDI Theater Control System

This directory contains 3D models and manufacturing files for the physical components of the MIDI theater lighting control system.

## 🤖 Bruno - Theater Smoke Machine Remote Control Robot

Bruno is a retro-futuristic robotic remote controller designed as a reliable backup operator for professional theater smoke effects. When Multiplay automation fails, Bruno's simple "lift head → press button" operation keeps the show running perfectly.
